512x512
A stylized logo for a 2048 game app. The logo features a bold, modern 4x4 grid outline in a dark gray color. Inside the grid, the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 are arranged in ascending order from left to right, top to bottom, each number in a contrasting bright color (e.g., orange for 2, yellow for 4, green for 8, blue for 16, purple for 32, pink for 64, teal for 128, cyan for 256, magenta for 512, lime for 1024, and red for 2048). The background is a subtle gradient from light blue at the top to dark blue at the bottom, giving the logo a dynamic, energetic feel. The overall design is clean, modern, and instantly recognizable as a 2048 game logo.
